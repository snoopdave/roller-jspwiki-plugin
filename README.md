Roller JSP Wiki Plugin 
====
This Roller Weblog Entry plugin allows you to use JSPWiki syntax in Roller blog entries. 
This is the old Roller JSPWiki plugin updated to work with the latest Apache Roller and Apache JSPWiki codebases. 

How to build
---
Since the latest Roller and JSPWiki builds are not in Maven Central, you will have to first build Roller and JSPWiki.
You can do so like this.

First, get and build Apache Roller:

    $ git clone https://github.com/apache/roller.git
    $ cd roller
    $ mvn clean install
    
Next, get and build Apache JSPWiki:

    $ git clone https://github.com/apache/jspwiki.git
    $ cd jspwiki
    $ mvn clean install
    
And finally, get an build this plugin:

    $ git clone https://github.com/snoopdave/roller-jspwiki-plugin.git
    $ cd roller-jspwiki-plugin
    $ mvn clean install
